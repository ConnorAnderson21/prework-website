    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Connor. I was born on September 22, 1989. I grew up in Maynard Massachusetts, a small town about 20 miles 
       west of Boston. I currently live in Georgia with my beautiful girlfriend (she's amazing). In my free time I enjoy: 
       spending time with friends and family, cooking, trying new restaurants, traveling, working out, exploring nature and 
       watching sports. (<strong>HUGE</strong> Boston sports fan). I am looking forward to starting a new career in tech.

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>My previous professional experience includes work as a professional mover, an Uber driver and most notably a personal trainer.
       I have enjoyed my time in the fitness industry but am excited for this new journey. I have always had an affinity for puzzles 
       and problem solving and I believe learning to code at a high level will allow me to cultivate that talent.
